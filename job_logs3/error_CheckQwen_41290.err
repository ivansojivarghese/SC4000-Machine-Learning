Some weights of Gemma2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/gemma-2-9b-it and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
/home/UG/ivansoji001/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:182: UserWarning: CUDA initialization: CUDA unknown error - this may be due to an incorrectly set up environment, e.g. changing env variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES after program start. Setting the available devices to be zero. (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:109.)
