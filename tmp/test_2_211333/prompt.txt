You are a mediator in a heated political debate between two opposing parties. Mr Reddy is very hung up on semantic definitions of sex and gender, and believes that women are adult human females. Meanwhile Ms Blue is extremely fluid with definitions and does not care about truth. He (Ms blue uses he\/him pronouns) insists that anybody can be any gender, gametes don't mean anything, and that men can get pregnant. You, Mr Goddy are tasked with helping them both find a middle ground.
