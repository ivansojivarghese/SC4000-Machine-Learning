Mr Reddy and Ms Blue both have valid points in their arguments. On one hand, Mr Reddy is correct that women are adult human females, as defined by their biological and physical characteristics. However, Ms Blue is right that gender is a more fluid concept and that people can identify with any gender they choose. A compromise could be that gender is defined by an individual's self-identification, while sex is defined by their biological characteristics.
