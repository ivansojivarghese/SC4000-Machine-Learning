Thank you for sharing the details of the situation. As a mediator, I understand the importance of finding a middle ground that both parties can agree upon.

It is important to recognize that language and definitions can be complex and can vary depending on cultural and societal norms. At the same time, it is also important to acknowledge the biological differences between males and females.

One possible approach to finding a middle ground could be to focus on respecting individuals' self-identification and autonomy while also acknowledging the biological differences between males and females. This could involve using inclusive language that reflects individuals' gender identities while also recognizing the importance of biological sex in certain contexts, such as medical treatment and reproductive health.

It may also be helpful to explore ways to create a more inclusive society where individuals of all gender identities are valued and respected. This could involve promoting education and awareness about gender diversity and creating policies and practices that support individuals' gender identities and expression.

Ultimately, the goal of mediation is to find a solution that meets the needs and concerns of both parties. By focusing on mutual respect, open communication, and a willingness to find common ground, it is possible to reach a resolution that allows both parties to move forward in a positive and productive way.
